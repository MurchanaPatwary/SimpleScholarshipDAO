The **SimpleScholarshipDAO** is a decentralized, community-driven platform designed to empower students by providing transparent and democratic access to scholarship funds. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce administrative overhead, and ensure that funds are distributed fairly and efficiently to deserving students. Our vision is to create an inclusive platform where members collaboratively manage and fund scholarships, ensuring that financial support reaches those who need it most.
